- make popup that will see if admin show this popup with btns (invite, throw out, )
? some problem with friends (sinjikit131 & medo007 friends, but only medo007 has sinjikit131)
? send friend request send from user404 as well ???? (does not load quick enough after register)
? test new register (on iphone) adds the samsung profile, user404 still a problem?


⭐ Functionalities:
    ✅ PastData be by months
    ➡ Make color picker
    ➡ Change username
    ➡ Add arena admin to creator
    ➡ Automatic day finish / Option to finish for yesterday
        -> solution: save date to firebase, added it to vuex and check if(currentData !== new Date()){ finishDay() }
    ➡ Remove wrong day in PastData
    ➡ Make friends be seen in a list if you tap on friends on user/your profile
    ➡ as you register send email of welcome to user (with link to page of this app maybe)
    ➡ Able to make rounds for making pushups
    ➡ type pushups should lead to special site with something said about it (difficulty in stars, what to watch, what it hits)
    ➡ pushups streak !

🐜 Bugs:
    ✅ Username already taken in register [promises]
    ➡ after you register/login, make a loading fullscreen when directed to homepage
    ➡ Make for desktop, tablet
    ➡ Othe users profile should show friends (count) + able to see the friends list + the user can look his list of friends (remove/add -> redirect to loupe)
    ➡ Finish day should be a popup full width screen
    ➡ Restyle add pushups style (animation itd.)
    ➡ Fix the scss import to be global (like iOrder)


👉 Tasks:
    ✅ Reformat add friend component (to not be used for each user but onClick) 
    ✅ Add friend component should display limit 5 users + whatever it finds on search
    ✅ In Word diploma change the pics pri opisu tehnologij in dodaj besedilo in nove opise novih tehnologij
    ✅ Change of goal somewhere else and also on your profile tap on goal (maybe ... btn)
    ✅ Restyle AddPushups.vue
    ➡ Restyle Goal.vue (neuomophic, similar as AddPushups)

🚀 google account register
🚀 make forgot password
🚀 square under login make it rotate and scale up (maybe trasition to homepage)
🚀 use less firebase actions (use the store && only if not loaded yet), also make function that counts every time you call db.collections("users") so you know how many times it gets called (make it a smaller number)
🚀 vuex folders
🚀 in arenas make a voting system for adding players (like Greece)
🚀 what to add to profile (more stuff) -> see in other apps
